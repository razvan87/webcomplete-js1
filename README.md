## 📝 JavaScript Homework: Handling User Input, Data Types, and Arrays

### 🎯 **Objective:**
Create a program that collects and processes student information using functions and arrays. This exercise will test your understanding of **functions, data types, user input, arrays, and simple data manipulation.**

---

### 🛠️ **Instructions:**

#### 1️⃣ **Define a function `getUserInfo` that:**
*   Asks the user for their **name** using `prompt`.
*   Asks the user for their **age** using `prompt`.
*   Asks the user if they are **present** using `confirm`.
*   **Returns an object containing:**
    *   `name`: the user's name.
    *   `age`: the user's age (**as a number**).
    *   `attendance`: a **boolean** indicating whether the student is present.

> **Use this function to collect data for multiple students and store their information in an array.**

---

#### 2️⃣ **Create a function `showAttendancePercentage` that:**
*   **Calculates the percentage** of students who are present.
*   **Displays this percentage** in an `alert`. 

---

#### 3️⃣ **(3 points) Create a function `createTeams` that:**
*   Takes a **number as a parameter** (the desired number of teams).
*   Forms teams **only with present students**.
*   Distributes students across the teams in a **structured way** so that each team receives students in a **cyclic order**. 
*   **Shuffles the students** before assigning them to teams to ensure variety. 

**For 10 present students and 3 teams required, logs in the console the teams in the following format:**

```text
TEAM 1 
Student 1
Student 4
Student 7
Student 10
TEAM 2
Student 2
Student 5
Student 8
TEAM 3
Student 3
Student 6
Student 9
